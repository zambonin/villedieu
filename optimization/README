Set of exercises on graph theory and NP-completeness.

A Fortran wrapper for the multiple knapsack optimal solver found in [1] is
available, due to the unavaibility of such solutions in [2]. It needs
`gfortran` to be compiled. Note that the compiler's protection against stack
smashing is disabled, since the program complains after it finishes execution.
Surely the warning emitted by the compiler should have to do with this.

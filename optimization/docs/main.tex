    \item A decision problem $p \in \mathbf{NP}$ is called \textbf{NP}-complete if every decision problem in \textbf{NP} has a polynomial-time, many-one reduction to $p$. The travelling salesman problem in its decision version (TSPd) is an example of a \textbf{NP}-complete problem. Therefore, if one were to give a polynomial time algorithm to solve TSPd, and considering that it is possible to reduce all problems in \textbf{NP} to an instance of TSPd, one could solve these in polynomial time. In other words, \textbf{P} would be equal to \textbf{NP}.
    \item Recall that a problem $p$, not necessarily in \textbf{NP}, is \textbf{NP}-hard if there exists a polynomial-time, many-one reduction from a \textbf{NP}-complete problem to $p$. Usually, it is said that \textbf{NP}-hard problems are ``at least as hard as the hardest problems in \textbf{NP}'', \emph{i.e.} those that are \textbf{NP}-complete. If a polynomial reduction from a problem $q$ to $p$ exists, then by the definition above, $q$ is in the hardest class of problems, and may not even be solvable.
    \item The difference lies in the presence of a solution. To solve a problem, one should find a solution through an algorithm. On the other hand, to verify a problem, a solution is
